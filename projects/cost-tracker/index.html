            <h2>Why I built this app</h2>
            <p>I don't like getting blindsided by anything. Especially when it comes to subscriptions, insurance and similar. 
                I hate checking my mails and finding out there's an upcoming payment I forgot about. 
                That's why I started tracking all my expenses with Notion one day. That was a huge improvement and made me be far more aware of my finances. 
                While I think Notion is a great tool that I still love, it bothered me that from time to time, there were many features added cluttering the app and distracting me from the tasks I used it for. 
                Also while it's one of the most versatile tools there is, this means it is not tailored to the purpose of cost tracking. 
                When I was looking for an alternative onn the AppStore, I was shocked by the amount of Apps that offer Options for cost tracking, but with every app I looked at, they were either cluttered with "smart" features, subscription-based or just not pretty.
                I believe cost tracking has many purposes - one of them becoming aware of the recurring costs and how much you spend long-term. I believe paying a 3‚Ç¨ subscription for a cost tracker would be one of those unnessecary costs.
                So what I decided to do was just do it myself and maybe offer an App for those, that feel the same.
                Cost Tracker is for people who value simplicity and focus. Inspired by iOS design, it's a truly native-feeling app that does one thing ‚Äî track your regular expenses‚Äîbeautifully and efficiently. 
                There are no ads, no subscriptions, and no hidden fees: just a single, one-time purchase. There also won't be any features added that distract from the core purpose (no AI chat function to "help" you get your life under control). No bloat, no distractions - just the essentials, done right.</p>

                <li>German translation is not fully completed. In Build 8 it will almost be finished, with one exception I still have to address. Build 9 will probably include full German support.</li>
